You can play our game on Itch.io! - https://sooshimi.itch.io/golden-biscuit

Golden Biscuit was made in participation in 'Brackeys Game Jam 2025.2'. This was a 7-day game jam (although we made it in 4 days), and the theme was 'Risk it for a biscuit'.

This game was made in the Godot engine (v4.4.1).
